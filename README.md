# Stack-Implementation-Computer-graphics
Implementing Stack data structure using OpenGL library

This project can be directly opened in Visual Studio with an additional package import. You just need to install GLUT package, which can be found in NuGet.

Open your solution, click TOOLS->NuGet Package Manager->Package Manager Console to open a NuGet console, type Install-Package freeglut.

I used nupengl.core package instead which works fine. If the Visual Studio version is 2013 then nupengl.core package is what needs to be installed.
